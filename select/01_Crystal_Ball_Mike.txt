Uh
It's M-to-the-IZZ-I
Ooh

Yo
It's M-to-the-IZZ-I, don't forget the K-E
The money where I reside, don't forget to pay me
At best I'ma wig out, niggas couldn't train me
I dreamt about a big house, low-key on the daily

Remember we would sit out, showed me where they paid green
You flexing just to stick out, I flex because of great genes
Suppressive of a big smile, why I had to shave clean
And let a ray beam, forget I been a bit wild

Triumph in my latе teens, treasuring my mid now
That's what hate bring, uh
If I project, it'd bе a missile, persistent as your aim be
The message never get 'round, I'm sitting with the same peace
Regret it if I let down, but shit you gotta change speed

Bent I'ma slizzide, fresher than an AC
So death by my sizzide
Why I gotta pay respects to the skizz-i
Paranoia chase me
It's M-to-the-IZZ-I, don't forget the K-E
Money where I reside, don't forget to pay me
Bent I'ma slizzide, fresher than an AC
So death by my sizzide
Why I gotta pay respects to the skizz-i
Paranoia chase me

Know it's M-to-the-IZZ-I, don't forget the K-E
