Tossin' and turnin'
Shakin' and burnin'
My dream's got me screaming in pain
Hopin' and prayin'
Livin' and dyin'
Got my mind in an awful state
Makin' my bread
Raisin' the dead
Every story has a bitter end
Chopped in the garden
Beepin' and bawlin'
Got the reaper as my best friend
(Why)
And so the fortune teller dropped another
Lover with her hands upon his still beating heart
(Why)
With the might of a tiger she clawed at
His armor and left him alone in the dark
(Why)
With no choice but to run like a dog with
No bun he steamed as the questions remained
(Why)
How worthy my piece with a girl such
As she with the light of eternal shame
(I wanna know) I wanna know why
(I wanna know) I wanna know why
(I wanna know) I wanna know why
(I wanna know) I wanna know how
(I wanna know) Ooh
(I wanna know) Where you lay?
(I wanna know) Where you'll be?
(I wanna know) Why you smilin'?
Why the crystal ball set me free
Why the crystal ball set me free
Tossin' and turnin'
Shakin' and burnin'
My dreams' got me screaming in pain
Hopin' and prayin'
Livin' and dyin'
Got my mind in an awful state
Makin' my bread
Raisin' the dead
Every story has a bitter end
Chopped in the garden
Beepin' and bawlin'
Got the reaper as my best friend
(Why)
And to this day when that fortune
Teller plays with the fates of innocent men
(Why)
She smiles at the thought as her
Fingertips get hot at the boy she will torture again
(Why)
Take it from me for I was set free from
The love that was doomed from the start
(Why)
When you see that red tent and your body's
Been spent run away with your hands on your heart
(I wanna know) I wanna know why
(I wanna know) I wanna know why
(I wanna know) I wanna know where
(I wanna know) I wanna know how
(I wanna know) Ooh
(I wanna know) Where you lay?
(I wanna know) Where you'll be?
(I wanna know) Why you smilin'?
Why your crystal ball set me free
Why your crystal ball set me free
Why your crystal ball set me free
Why your crystal ball set me free
