Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a crystal ball?
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a crystal ball?
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a crystal ball?

As bombs explode around us
And hate advances on the right
The only thing that matters, baby
Is the love we make tonight
As little babies in makeup terrorize the western world
The only that matters, baby
Is love between a boy and girl

Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a crystal ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

I can't remember my baby's voice
'Cuz she ain't talking no more
Only the sound of love and prayer echo from the yellow floor, yellow floor
Huh, She sayin', "Dear Jesus, save us from temptation
Dear Jesus, save us from hell
Save us from the madness that threatens us all
Can you hear us?
It's hard to tell
In your name we pray."

Expert lover, my baby
Have you ever had a crystal ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

As soldiers draw swords of sorrow
My baby draws pictures of sex (Yes, she does)
All over the walls in graphic detail, sex!

Everybody say it now
Expert lover, my baby
Have you ever had a crystal ball?
Under- undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

Expect lover, my baby
Ever had a crystal ball?
Expert lover, my baby (My baby)
Ever had a crystal ball?

Crystal ball
Expert

My baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, kiss me, lick me, trick me, whoa!
Hey, Yeah, yeah!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, won't you come on?

Expert lover, my baby
Have you ever had a crystal ball?

Don't you wanna?
What my drummer wanna say?
What my drummer wanna say?
Yeah! Drummer!
Tell me what the bass say

Woo woo woo
Yeah
Oh, ow!
Listen to my, listen to my bass man play
(Alright, expert lover, my baby is alright)
(Alright, undercover, my baby is alright)
Listen to the guitar play, hey!
Wait a minute now, it's groovy!
Ouch!
Guitar, guitar
Come on now
Oh yeah!

My baby licked me fast
Her mama watch her gas
Come on baby, do me fast
Come on, come on
Your mathematical gas!

Uh
Ohh wee!
Darling, darling you know you want a cry- crystal ball
Crystal ball
"I don't know, I have to ask my mommy first."
As bombs explode around you and hate advances on your right
The only thing you can be sure of is the love we make tonight

Expert lover, my baby
Ever had a crystal ball?
Take off your clothes, baby
Come on, get the crystal ball
Oh, expert lover, my baby
You ever had a crystal ball?
Come on, take off your clothes baby
Come on, get the crystal ball

Expect lover, my baby
