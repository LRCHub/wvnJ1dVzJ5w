We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery

We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside the magic starts

Gaze into my crystal ball
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all?
My crystal ball

You veil your eyes in fantasy
Let's pull the curtain back
Distant worlds so much to see

Gaze into my crystal ball
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all?
In my crystal ball

I wanna know you
Common, let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you
Reach out to these hands of fate

I wanna know you
Common, let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you
Reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for
Oh, yeah

Gaze into my crystal ball
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all?
In my crystal ball
Gaze into my crystal ball
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all?
